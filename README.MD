Hello, I'm 
# Damian Kleiman

I'm from Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina. 

Python is my life, I've been using it for over 20 years (close 30 now, oh my god). It was my choice many years ago with JavaScript (which you can't choose really because its what a browser understands - thanks Netscape). The JS framework I'm using is NextJS.
Lately I've been doing a lot of Data Science, GIS (Geospatial Information Services) and Backend Web development. I also like Mojo, altough I generally don't use it much.
In my spare time I do photography (which you can see on Instagram) and music.

## My development environment

I always get asked what I use (although I think it does not really matter) so here it is:
Terminal:
`
WezTerm 
`
(I switched to this amazing terminal at the beginning of 2025 and I'm using it on all Operating Systems. If you don't know it, check wezfurlong.org/wezterm.)
Editor:
` 
NeoVim, VSCode
`
Operating Systems:
`
Desktop PC: Windows+WSL, Notebook: MacOS, Other: Raspberry and Arduino
`
Clouds:
`
Amazon Web Services, Azure
`
I also love to use `Docker` a lot.

Prefered hardware:
`
Intel 13th gen processors, Intel ARC GPU, Raspberry, Arduino, ARM
`
