Hello, I'm 
# Damian Kleiman

I'm from Rosario Argentina. 

Python is my life, I've been using it for over 15 years. Lately I've been doing a lot of Data Science and Backend Web development. I also like photography and music, but that's for another site :) .

NOTE: I had to create a new GitHub account, because for some reason the 2FA stopped working, and GitHub support could not fix it for me. So I have this new account, only thing I could recover was username. So old stuff lives now on DamianK-zz but its read-only. I will be updating these repos soon, when I have time.
