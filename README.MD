Hello, I'm 
# Damian Kleiman

I'm from Rosario, Argentina. 

Python is my life, I've been using it for over 20 years. It was my choice many years ago with JavaScript (which you can't choose really because its what a browser understands - thanks Netscape).
Lately I've been doing a lot of Data Science, GIS (Geospatial Information Services) and Backend Web development. I also like Mojo.
In my spare time I do photography (which you can see on Instagram) and music.

## My development environment

I always get asked what I use (although I think it does not really matter) so here it is:
Terminal:
`
Alacritty (and sometimes iTerm on macOS)
`
Editor:
` 
NeoVim
`
Operating Systems:
`
Desktop PC: Windows+WSL, Notebook: MacOS, Other: Raspberry and Arduino
`
Clouds:
`
Amazon Web Services, Heroku, Azure & GCP
`
I also love to use `Docker` a lot.

Prefered hardware:
`
Intel 13th gen processors, Intel ARC GPU, Raspberry, Arduino, ARM
`
