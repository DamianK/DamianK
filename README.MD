Hello, welcome to my corner in GitHub. I'm 
# Damian Kleiman

I'm from Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina. 

Python is my life, I've been using it for over 20 years. Lately I've been doing a lot of Data Science, GIS and Backend Web development. I also like photography and music, but that's for another site :) (check below)

## My development environment

I always get asked what I use (although I think it does not really matter) so here it is:
Editor:
` 
NeoVim (nerdy I know..)
`
Operating Systems:
`
Desktop PC: Windows+WSL, Notebook: MacOS
`
Clouds:
`
Amazon Web Services, Heroku, Azure & GCP
`

Prefered hardware:
`
Intel 13th gen processors, Intel ARC GPU, Raspberry, ARM
`
I also love to use `Docker` a lot
