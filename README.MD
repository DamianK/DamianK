Hello, I'm 
# Damian Kleiman

Welcome 2026!

I'm from Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina. I started programming back in the C64 era with Basic, and then I switched to a Commodore Amiga and after that to a PC. I did some desktop applications in Pascal and later switched to web development using PHP, back in the time where PHP wasn't really awesome. Sometime later I discovered Python, and I loved it. Python is my life, I've been using it for over 20 years now (core, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Odoo, etc). It was my choice many years ago with JavaScript (which you can't choose really because its what a browser understands - thanks Netscape). The JS frameworks I'm using are mainly React and  NextJS, just because I need to use them to understand frontend. I also sometimes go back to PHP again, on client requests.

Lately I've been doing a lot of Data Science, GIS (Geospatial Information Systems) and Backend Web development. I've been using PostGIS a lot. 
In my spare time I do photography (which you can see on Instagram), music (which I'm too embarrased to share anywhere) and drawings.

## My development environment

I always get asked what I use (although I think it does not really matter) so here it is:

Terminal:
`
Ghotty (using with Zsh and Oh-My-Zsh)
`
I went back to Ghostty after using Wezterm for a while. I'm using it on Linux now.

SSH Client:
`
Termius
`

Editors:
` 
NeoVim, VSCode
`

Operating Systems:
`
I'm now using Ubuntu Desktop on my PC. I also have another disk with Omarchy (@dhh 's distribution of ArchLinux). Other OSs I use: Raspberry and Arduino. I completely stopped using Winoows 11 everywhere after the last update. My macBook is now dead, so also no macOS at this moment.
`
Clouds:
`
Amazon Web Services, Azure
`
I also use `Docker` a lot.

Prefered hardware:
`
Intel processors, AMD GPUs, Raspberry, Arduino, other ARM chips like Snapdragon X Elite.
`

AIs I use:
`
I'm currently using Copilot, Codeium & Sonnet (depending on tasks) and Grok on X
`

## A bit more about Hobbies
Altough I consider them hobbies, both photography and music have been sources of income (and sometimes are) my whole life. If you have interesting projects related to them do not hesitate to contact me.
