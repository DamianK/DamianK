Hello, I'm 
# Damian Kleiman

I'm from Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina. 
Python is my life, I've been using it for over 20 years (core, Django, Flask, FastAPI, Odoo, etc). It was my choice many years ago with JavaScript (which you can't choose really because its what a browser understands - thanks Netscape). The JS frameworks I'm using are mainly React and  NextJS.
Lately I've been doing a lot of Data Science, GIS (Geospatial Information Systems) and Backend Web development. I've been using PostGIS a lot. I also like Mojo, altough I generally don't use it much. I'm doing quite a lot of data projects.
In my spare time I do photography (which you can see on Instagram), music (which I'm too embarrased to share anywhere) and drawings.
One of my goals for 2025 is to learn new technologies, and probably get again into mobile development, and obviously some AI. We'll see. 

## My development environment

I always get asked what I use (although I think it does not really matter) so here it is:
Terminal:
`
WezTerm (using with Zsh and Oh-My-Zsh)
`
SSH Client:
`
Termius
`
I switched to this amazing terminal at the beginning of 2025 after using Ghostty for a while and I'm using it on macOS now. If you don't know it, check wezfurlong.org/wezterm.
Editors:
` 
NeoVim, VSCode
`
Operating Systems:
`
I'm now using macOS on a Desktop PC. Other OSs I use: Raspberry and Arduino
`
Clouds:
`
Amazon Web Services, Azure
`
I also use `Docker` a lot.

Prefered hardware:
`
Intel processors, AMD GPUs, Apple Silicon, Raspberry, Arduino, other ARM chips like Snapdragon.

## A bit more about Hobbies
