Hello, I'm 
# Damian Kleiman

I'm from Rosario, Santa Fe, Argentina. 
Python is my life, I've been using it for over 20 years. It was my choice many years ago with JavaScript (which you can't choose really because its what a browser understands - thanks Netscape). The JS frameworks I'm using are React and  NextJS.
Lately I've been doing a lot of Data Science, GIS (Geospatial Information Systems) and Backend Web development. I've been using PostGIS a lot. I also like Mojo, altough I generally don't use it much.
In my spare time I do photography (which you can see on Instagram) and music (which I'm to embarrased to share anywhere).

## My development environment

I always get asked what I use (although I think it does not really matter) so here it is:
Terminal:
`
WezTerm (using with Zsh and Oh-My-Zsh)
`
I switched to this amazing terminal at the beginning of 2025 and I'm using it on macOS now. If you don't know it, check wezfurlong.org/wezterm.
Editors:
` 
NeoVim, VSCode
`
Operating Systems:
`
I'm now using macOS on both Desktop PC and laptop. Other OSs I use: Raspberry and Arduino
`
Clouds:
`
Amazon Web Services, Azure
`
I also use `Docker` a lot.

Prefered hardware:
`
Intel 13th gen processors, NVidia GPU, Raspberry, Arduino, ARM
`
